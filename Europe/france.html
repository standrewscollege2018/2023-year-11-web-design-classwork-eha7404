    <h2>France</h2>
    <p>We hit France in the middle of a heat-wave, and spent a lot of time either indoors or hiding in the shade.</p>
    <p>Paris was wonderful, and we enjoyed walking along the banks of River Seine, plus seeing all the famous sights. </p>
    <p>We also drove down to Mont St Michel and visited the beaches of Normandy.</p>
